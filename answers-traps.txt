Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
 - a0 - a7,  a2 hold 13;

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
 - 被内联了，li	a2,13 将 13 这个值给到了 a2 寄存器

At what address is the function printf located?
 - jalr	1528(ra) # 628 <printf>  由此可以看出，其跳转到了 628 处， 代码中 printf 的定位也可以看出起始位置为 628

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
